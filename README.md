# JAVA-using-swing-to-draw

One of the projects that i did in my Computer science 2 class, which used java. There are a couple of exercises in each homework we had.
For this one we needed to use swing to do a couple of drawings. There is an exercise that had a googly eye. I also made a mini calculator with basic functionality etc.
